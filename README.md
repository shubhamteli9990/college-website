# college-website
Hello everyone, my name is Shubham. I am working on a project to create a college website. This website will make it easy for students and visitors to find information about the different facilities and resources the college offers. Users can learn about the services available, the academic programs, campus amenities, and more.

# how to setup the project in our pc
Step 1: Download and Extract the ZIP File
   Download the zip file from the source location.
   Once the download is complete, right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract All" or use a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files.
   
Step 2: Open the index.html File in Visual Studio Code
   Open Visual Studio Code or any other preferred code editor.
   In Visual Studio Code:
   Go to File > Open Folder.
   Navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file and open the folder.
   Once the folder is opened, locate the index.html file within the folder structure and open it by clicking on it.

Step 3: Check All Image and File Paths
   In the index.html file, check the paths for the images and other files (like CSS, JS, etc.). These are usually located within <img>, <link>, and <script> tags.
            
   Example for images:
   <img src="images/image1.jpg" alt="Image Description">
   Example for CSS:
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
   Example for JavaScript:
   <script src="scripts/app.js"></script>

   Verify that the paths point to the correct locations of the files. If any path is incorrect, fix it by providing the correct relative or absolute path.

Step 4: Run the 2.html File
   Right-click on the index.html file in Visual Studio Code.
   Select "Open with Live Server" if you have the Live Server extension installed, or simply open the file in a browser by double-clicking it in your file explorer.
   Check if the web page is working as expected:
   Ensure all images are loaded.
   Verify that styles (CSS) are applied correctly.
   Test if the JavaScript (if any) works as intended.
   
Step 5: Edit Other Files (course.html, facility.html, hostel.html, about.html, result.html)
   Open each file (course.html, facility.html, hostel.html, about.html, result.html) one by one in Visual Studio Code.
   Check for typos, punctuation, and sentence clarity in each file.

Step 6: Save and Test Each File
   Save the changes in each file after correcting grammar and sentences.
   Open the updated files (course.html, facility.html, etc.) in your browser or through Live Server to verify that the changes are displayed correctly and the pages are functioning without errors.
